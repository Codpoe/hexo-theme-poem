## Features
### First Screen
On the first screen, you can choose to show the image or the color-gradient.

Note: If the image or the color you set is dark, remember set the `dark` in `hexo-theme-poem/_config.yaml` to true, or you may not recognize your words (header words, first screen words...) from the background.

### Read More
At most time, we don't want to show the full content of the post, then You can seperate your post content with `<!--more-->`. The content behind the `<!--more-->` will be hidden on the home page.

### Normal Page
If you want to add a normal page with header and footer(eg. the about page), just create a folder that contains a `index.md` file in the `source` folder in the root directory, and add `layout: normal` in `front-matter` in `index.md`.

Note that the normal page will open the comments by default. If you want to close the comments, just normal, add `comments: false` in `front-matter` in `index.md`.

### Clean Page
If you want to add a clean page with nothing that you can customize completely, just create a folder that contains a `index.html` file in the `source` folder in the root directory.

### Languages
Currently only English(default) and Simplified Chinese(zh-CN) are supported.

## More
### How to navigate to the new page?
The url of the new page(normal page or clean page) is `http(s)://[your site address]/[the name of the folder that contains the new page]`.

## Todo
- Some widgets
- The progress bar of the post page
